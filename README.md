# Matrices and Linear Algebra: Solving `Ax = b`

We will discuss different ways to solve the same problem:

How do we find a solution for `x₁` and `x₂` that solves the following equation?

```
    A          x         b
----------------------------
|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   | -3 |

```

We will propose four different methods, and show how they relate to each other. These methods are:

1. System of Linear Equations (SLE)
1. Geometrical Interpretation
1. Gauss-Jordan Elimination (or Gaussian Elimination)
1. Inverse Matrix

Interesting enough, we will also be able to use each method in conjunction to the others. For example, we will see how to use SLE, Gaussian Elimination and geometrical interpretation to find the Inverse Matrix. Let's start!

## 1. System of Linear Equations (SLE)

Using matrix multiplication, we can rewrite the problem in terms of two linear equations:

```
|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  5 |   ==>  2x₁ + x₂ = 5
            |  x₂ |

and

| -2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  -3 |   ==>  -2x₁ + x₂ = -3
            |  x₂ |

That is, we need to find x₁ and x₂ that satisfy both equations:
(i)   2x₁ + x₂ =  5
(ii) -2x₁ + x₂ = -3
```

There are two common ways to solve this:

- Eliminating one variable from both equations
- Isolating and substituting one variable into the other equation

Let's see both:

### a) Eliminating `x₁`

We know that adding a constant to both sides of an equation doesn't change the validity of the expression. So, let's add `5` to both sides `(ii)`:

```
(iii) -2x₁ + x₂ + 5 = -3 + 5
```

We also know from `(i)` that `2x₁ + x₂ = 5`. Let's use it to substitute in `(iii)`:

```
(iv) -2x₁ + x₂ + (2x₁ + x₂) = -3 + 5
```

Notice that we chose such values that would eliminate `x₁` from the equation. This is equivalent of Simplifying both sides:

```
(v)   2x₂ = 2
(vi)   x₂ = 1
```

Now that we know the value of `x₂`, we can substitute back in the initial equations and find `x₁`:

```
(vii)   2x₁ + 1 =  5   ==>  2x₁ =  4   ==>  x₁ =  2
(viii) -2x₁ + 1 = -3   ==> -2x₁ = -4   ==>  x₁ =  2
```

Our solution is `x₁ = 2; x₂ = 1;`

### b) Isolating and Substituting `x₂`

Since `x₂` is the easiest variable to isolate, we will use it.

```
(i)   2x₁ + x₂ =  5
(ii) -2x₁ + x₂ = -3
```

From `(i)`:

```
(iii)   x₂ =  -2x₁ + 5
```

Substituting `(iii)` into `(ii)`:

```
(iv) -2x₁ + (-2x₁ + 5) = -3   ==>   -4x₁ = -8  ==>  x₁ = 2
```

Substituting `(iv)` back into `(iii)`:

```
(v)  x₂ =  -2(2) + 5 =  -4 + 5 = -1
```

As we expected, the solution is `x₁ = 2; x₂ = 1;`

## 2. Geometrical Interpretation

By plotting the problem into a Cartesian Plan, we can find the solution. Again, we will see two different methods to plot this problem, and solve both:

- Line equations (the row problem)
- Vectors (the column problem)

### a) Line equations (the row problem)

The equations of our SLE can be plotted in the Cartesian plan as two lines:

```
(i)   2x₁ + x₂ =  5
(ii) -2x₁ + x₂ = -3
```

One easy way to plot them is by finding the intercepts, that is, the value in which the line intercepts the axes:

For `(i)`:

```
When x₁ = 0, then x₂ =  5
When x₂ = 0, then 2x₁ = 5  ==> x₁ = 5 / 2
```

For `(ii)`:

```
When x₁ = 0, then   x₂ = -3
When x₂ = 0, then -2x₁ = -3  ==> x₁ = 3 / 2
```

// TODO: insert image 1

From the image above, we see in red all points that satisfy `(ii)`, and in purple all points that satisfy `(i)`. We also see in blue the only point that satisfy both equations, `(2,1)`, which is the solution to our problem. We are going to discuss in the next section why we name this interpretation as the "row problem".

### b) Vectors (the column problem)

Notice that in the previous method, we thought about our problem `Ax = b` in term of the rows of `A` and `b`:

```
(i)  |  2  1 |    ==>   2x₁ + x₂ =  5     |  5 |
     ---------                            ------
(ii) | -2  1 |    ==>  -2x₁ + x₂ = -3     | -3 |
```

For this next geometrical interpretation, we will look at the columns of `A` and `b`:

```
  c₁   c₂                  c₁         c₂        b
---------------------------------------------------
|  2 || 1 |    ==>   x₁ |  2 | + x₂ |  1 | = |  5 |
| -2 || 1 |    ==>      | -2 |      |  1 | = | -3 |
```

Now, instead of having a SLE, we have a linear combination of two vectors `c₁ = (2,-2)` and `c₂ = (1,1)`, resulting in the vector `b = (5, -3)`. So, if by adding and scaling c₁ and c₂ we get the vector `b`, than the combinations `x₁` and `x₂` used to scale `c₁` and `c₂`, respectively, are the solution to the problem.

// TODO: insert image 2

From the image above, we see in red the vector `c₁`, in purple the vector `c₂` and in blue the vector `b`. It is also possible to notice that (only) when we add `c₁` scaled by `2` and `c₂` (scaled by `1`), we get `b`. As expected, `x₁ = 2` and `x₂ = 1`.

## 3) Gauss-Jordan Elimination

Using an augmented matrix, we can perform three elementary row operations to reduce the matrix to Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). These operations are:

- Switch the position of two rows
- Multiply a row by any non-zero constant
- Add a scalar multiple of one row to any other row

```
(i)   |  2  1 |  5 |   1/2(i)
(ii)  | -2  1 | -3 |   1/2(ii)

(iii) |  1  1/2 |  5/2 |
(iv)  | -1  1/2 | -3/2 |   (i) + (ii)

(v)   |  1  1/2 |  5/2 |   (i) - 1/2(ii)
(vi)  |  0   1  |   1  |

(vii)  |  1  0  |  2 |   RREF(A)
(viii) |  0  1  |  1 |
```

From performing the same operations in both sides of the equation - that is, `Ax` and `b` - the valitidy of the expression holds true. So, we can rewrite the problem as:

```
|  1  0 | . |  x₁ | = |  2 |
|  0  1 |   |  x₂ |   |  1 |
```

Which is equivalent of `x₁ = 2; x₂ = 1`, as expected.

## 4) Inverse Matrix

Before learning multiple methods to find the Inverse Matrix, let's first understand what is and why do we want to find the Inverse Matrix.

Let's take one step back before we move forward:

### a) Solving the problem with just `1` equation and `1` variable

How do we solve a linear equation with just one variable, `x`?

The most straight-forward way is by isolating the variable:
For example:

```
A = 3; b = 12;

3x = 12
3x / 3 = 12 / 3
x = 4

```

In `(ii)`, we isolate `x` to find the solution. The way we do so is by diving both sides by `A`. In a more general solution:

```
Ax = b
Ax / A = b / A
x = b / A

for A, x and b are scalars, and A ≠ 0.
```

Now back to our original problem:

### b) Solving the problem with `2` equations and `2` variables

```
    A          x         b
----------------------------
|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   | -3 |

```

Could we try to solve this problem using the same method that we used in the previous section? That is:

```
|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   | -3 |

Let's rewrite the right side so there is a matrix and a vector:

|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  1  0 ||  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   |  0  1 || -3 |

Now let's try to divide both sides by A:

|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  1  0 ||  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   |  0  1 || -3 |         ┐(´•_•`)┌ WHAT❔❔
---------             ---------
|  2  1 |             |  2  1 |
| -2  1 |             | -2  1 |

And then:

|  x₁ | = |  1  0 ||  5 |
|  x₂ |   |  0  1 || -3 |                     ヽ(O_O )ﾉ Whaaat❔❔
          ---------
          |  2  1 |
          | -2  1 |

```

Can we solve it like this?

NO! We cannot! Division by matrix is not defined, so dividing `A` and `I` by `A` are not valid operations.
However, not all is lost! If we find one (defined) operation that we could perform in both sides that isolates `x`, then we find the solution:

```

Ax = b can be rewritten as:

|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  1  0 ||  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   |  0  1 || -3 |

```

If we find any matrix `M` that when multiplied by `A` we get `I`, then we can perform the same operation in both sides of the equation to isolate `x`:

```

M . |  2  1 | . | x₁ | = M . |  1  0 | . |  5 |
    | -2  1 |   | x₂ |       |  0  1 |   | -3 |

```

By definition of our proposed `M`:

```
M . |  2  1 |  = |  1  0 |
    | -2  1 |    |  0  1 |
```

And by definition of `I`:

```
M . |  1  0 | = M
    |  0  1 |
```

Therefore:

```
|  1  0 | . | x₁ | = M . |  5 |
|  0  1 |   | x₂ |       | -3 |

And:

| x₁ | = M. |  5 |
| x₂ |      | -3 |

```

We managed to isolate `x`. By multiplying matrix `M` by the vector `b = (5,-3)`, we find `x₁` and `x₂`, and solve our problem. Now, we just need to find `M`, if it exists.

### c) Definition of the Inverse Matrix

You probably guessed by now that `M` is not any matrix. The Inverse Matrix of any given matrix `A` is the matrix that when multiplied by `A`, results in `I`.

Instead of calling it `M`, the typical notation of the inverse of `A` is `A⁻¹`, or `inv(A) = A⁻¹`. By definition, `A⁻¹. A = A . A⁻¹ = I`.

We will not discuss the several properties of an Inverse Matrix here. Instead, we will dive into several methods for finding the inverse. The idea is that by solving and thinking of it differently, it will consolidate your mathematical intuition and reasoning.

### d) Finding the Inverse Matrix

Let's find out how to find the inverse matrix:

- SLE
- Gauss-Jordan
- Geometrical interpretation (Matrix Composition)
- Cramer's Rule

This seems just as hard as solving the problem in the first place! Well, it is! However, once you find the Inverse once, you can reuse it to find the solution to any vector `b`:

```
| x₁ | = A⁻¹ . | b₁ |
| x₂ |         | b₂ |
```

So, there will be ocasions where solving a system of linear equations by finding an inverse matrix will be just too much work. But, in other cases, it will be a time saver! The trick is to be able to differentiate these occasions, and choose the best method known. For that, let's learn some methods:

### I) SLE

We can solve two SLE to find the inverse matrix so we can solve a SLE (or several, or use the inverse for any other reason). Let's start with our definition `A . A⁻¹ = I`:

```
A⁻¹ . |  2  1 |  = |  1  0 |
      | -2  1 |    |  0  1 |
```

We know by the properties of an inverse matrix that `A⁻¹` has the same dimensions as `A`, that is, `A⁻¹` is a `2x2` matrix. So let's write `A⁻¹` using variables:

```
|  a  b | . |  2  1 |  = |  1  0 |
|  c  d |   | -2  1 |    |  0  1 |

By performing the multiplication of matrices:

| 2a-2b  a+b | = |  1  0 |
| 2c-2d  c+d | = |  0  1 |
```

From the equality above:

```
(i)   2a - 2b = 1
(ii)   a +  b = 0

(iii) 2c - 2d = 0
(iv)   c +  d = 1
```

Using any methods explained in the first section, we solve for all variables:

```
(i) + 2(ii)  ==>  4a = 1  ==>  a = 1/4
(ii)  ==> 1/4 + b = 0  ==>  b = -1/4

(iii) + 2(iv)  ==>  4c = 2 ==> c = 1/2
(iv)  ==>  1/2 + d = 1  ==>  d = 1/2

Therefore:
A⁻¹ = | 1/4  -1/4 |
      | 1/2   1/2 |

```

As we know from solving SLE, we can either find one solution, infinite solutions or no solution at all. Therefore, not always there will be an inverse.

- When there is no inverse, we say that the matrix is _singular_.
- In the example above, `A` is has an inverse `A⁻¹`, therefore we say that A is _invertible_.

### II) Gauss-Jordan

Using Gauss-Jordan to find an inverse is almost exactly the same process as explained previously. The only difference is that instead of augmenting the matrix `A` by `b`, we will be augmenting it by `I`:

```
(i)   |  2  1 |  1  0 |   1/2(i)
(ii)  | -2  1 |  0  1 |   1/2(ii)

(iii) |  1  1/2 |  1/2  0 |
(iv)  | -1  1/2 |  0  1/2 |   (i) + (ii)

(v)   |  1  1/2 |  1/2   0  |   (i) - 1/2(ii)
(vi)  |  0   1  |  1/2  1/2 |

(vii) |  1  0  |  1/4  -1/4 |   RREF(A)
(viii)|  0  1  |  1/2   1/2 |
```

Notice that the steps we used to reduce `A` to `RREF` were exactly the same as before, what changed was only what was in the right side of the augmented matrix. Well, this makes sense:

```
Starting from:

    A     .    x    =     I     .    b
----------------------------------------
|  2  1 | . |  x₁ | = |  1  0 | . |  5 |
| -2  1 |   |  x₂ |   |  0  1 |   | -3 |

and performing the steps we performed above, it results in:

    I     .    x    =       A⁻¹      .    b
-----------------------------------------------------------------
|  1  0 | . |  x₁ | = |  1/4  -1/4 | . |  5 | = |  8/4 | = |  2 |
|  0  1 |   |  x₂ |   |  1/2   1/2 |   | -3 |   |  2/2 |   |  1 |

```

Which is exactly the solution we found before.

### III) Geometrical Interpretation (Matrix Composition)

We can represent the matrix `A` in a cartesian plan.

// TODO: insert image 3

The objective is to find the inverse matrix, which would transform `A` into `I`.
So, let's try to find a composition of simple matrices that does the same.
Luckily, in this example it will be easy.

First thing, let's verify that the vectors `c₁ = (2,-2)` and `c₂ = (1,1)` are orthogonal. We can use the dot product to do it. As we know, the dot product of orthogonal vectors is `0`.

```
|  2 | . |  1 | = 2 - 2 = 0  ==>  orthogonal
| -2 |   |  1 |
```

Being so, we will rotate `c₁` and `c₂` by 45° anti-clockwise. Let's review the formula for a rotation matrix:

```
Rotation Matrix
----------------
| cosθ -sinθ |
| sinθ  cosθ |
```

We can find the formula using the unit circle:

// TODO: insert image 4

Therefore, for θ = 45° we get:

```
| √2/2  -√2/2 |
| √2/2   √2/2 |
```

// TODO: insert image 5

Now, we need to transform `c₁` and `c₂` into _Unit Vectors_. As we know, _Unit Vectors_ have length equal `1`. The way to to do it is by scaling each vector by `1/||c₁||` and `1/||c₂||`, respectively.

Let's find `||c₁||` and `||c₂||`:

```
c₁ = |  2 |   c₂ = |  1 |
     | -2 |        |  1 |

Using the dot product:

||c₁||² = |  2 | . |  2 | = 2.2 + (-2).(-2) = 8
          | -2 |   | -2 |

||c₂||² = |  1 | . |  1 | = 1 + 1 = 2
          |  1 |   |  1 |

Using Pythagoras:
          __________
||c₁|| = √2² + (-2)² = √8
          _______
||c₂|| = √1² + 1² = √2
```

Simplifying:

```
||c₁|| = 2√2
||c₂|| = √2

1/||c₁|| = 1 / 2√2 = √2/4
1/||c₂|| = 1 /  √2 = √2/2
```

The transformation matrix that scales `c₁` and `c₂` by `√2/4` and `√2/2`, respectively, is:

```
| √2/4   0  |
|   0  √2/2 |
```

//TODO: insert image 6

As we intended, we found a matrix composition that when applied to `A` transform it into `I`. It is:

```
| √2/4   0  | . | √2/2  -√2/2 |
|   0  √2/2 | . | √2/2   √2/2 |
```

If so, the result of the multiplication of both matrices is equal to `inv(A)`. Let's verify by performing the multiplication:

```
| √2/4   0  | . | √2/2  -√2/2 | = | √2/4 . √2/2    √2/4 .-√2/2 | = | 1/4  -1/4 |
|   0  √2/2 | . | √2/2   √2/2 |   | √2/2 . √2/2    √2/2 . √2/2 |   | 1/2   1/2 |
```

Which we know is `A⁻¹`.

### IV) Cramer's Rule

Cramer's Rule is not very intuitive and requires remembering so many steps that seems to me not very helpful. I will only briefly comment the general formula and show how we can easily find the inverse for 2x2 matrices. I will try also to discuss whichever intuition we can find by this method:

```
Cramer's Rule:

A⁻¹ =  adj(A) / det(A),

```

Where `adj(A)` is the _adjugate matrix_ and `det(A)` is the _determinant_.
The _adjugate matrix_ is the _transpose_ of its _cofactor matrix_. The _transpose_ of a matrix is achieved by swapping its columns into rows, and its rows into columns. The _cofactor matrix_ is achieved by finding the `n²` _determinants_ of smaller square matrices obtained by removing the respective row and column of each element, and multiplying by the correct signal (`+1` or `-1`).

Let's find these terms:

```
Cofactor Matrix of A
--------------------
A₁₁ = | ■     ■   |       A₁₂ = |   ■     ■ |
      | ■  det(1) |             | det(-2) ■ |

A₂₁ = | ■  det(1) |       A₂₂ = | det(2)  ■ |
      | ■     ■   |            |    ■    ■ |

Signal = -1 if i+j is odd   ==>   | +  - |
         +1 if i+j is even        | -  + |

C = |  1  2 |    Transpose(C) = |  1 -1 |
    | -1  2 |                   |  2  2 |

det(A) = 1.2 - (-2).1 = 2 + 2 = 4
```

So, our inverse matrix will be:

```
A⁻¹ = 1/4 . |  1 -1 | = |  1/4 -1/4 |
            |  2  2 |   |  1/2  1/2 |
```

Just as we found before.

There are only two things I think it's worth mentioning about this method:

1. Since the determinant is geometrically interpreted as the scaling of the space, it makes sense that the inverse matrix is divided by the determinant. If A expands the space by 4, the inverse will shrink the space to 1/4.
2. Memorizing the shortcut to solve a 2x2 matrix can be helpful to quickly verify the inverse: simply swap the elements A₁₁ and A₂₂, and change the signal from A₁₂ and A₂₁. Then divide by the determinant:

```
A = |  2  1 |    ==>  swap A₁₁ and A₂₂           ==> | 1/4 -1/4 | = | 1/4 -1/4 |
    | -2  1 |         change signal A₁₂ and A₂₁      | 2/4  2/4 |   | 1/2  1/2 |
                      divide by det(A)
```
